# SportRadar
SportRadar frontend challenge - Interactive sports event calendar with dynamic viewing and adding features.

Project Overview

A sports event calendar web app that allows users to view, interact with, and add sports events. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app features a responsive calendar view, event detail page, and a form for adding new events.
Prerequisites

    A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for running the project.
    (Optional) A local server for testing (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code).

Getting Started

    Clone the Repository:

    git clone git@github.com:vikassharma217/SportRadar.git
    cd SportRadar

    Open the Project:
        Using VS Code Live Server Extension (Recommended)
            Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
            Open the index.html file in VS Code.
            Right-click on index.html and select Open with Live Server.
            This will start a local development server and open the project in your default browser, allowing you to see changes in real-time.

        Using Pythonâ€™s Built-in HTTP Server
            This option works if you have Python installed.
            In the terminal, navigate to the project folder:
                        cd SportRadar
            Start a simple HTTP server using one of the following commands:
            For Python 3:
                        python3 -m http.server 8000
            For Python 2:
                        python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
            Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/index.html to view the project.

File Structure

    index.html: The main HTML file.
    styles/: Contains styles.css for styling the calendar and other elements.
    scripts/: JavaScript files for calendar logic, event handling, and form interactions.
    data/: JSON data file with mock sports event data (sportData.json).
    README.md: Project documentation (this file).
    approach.md: Additional documentation on project approach, sprint goals, and decisions.

    JavaScript: Handles calendar rendering, event data loading, and user interactions.
    JSON: Data format for storing and retrieving sports event information.

Run Instructions

    Simply open index.html in a browser to view the application.
    For dynamic updates during development, use a live server.
