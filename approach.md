Project Approach

This project follows a sprint-based approach, with each sprint dedicated to building and refining specific functionalities for a sports event calendar. The focus is on incremental progress, ensuring each core feature is implemented and tested before advancing to the next.
Overall Plan

    Sprint 1: Set up the project structure and placeholders in HTML for the calendar, navigation, and event detail views.
    Sprint 2: Build a static calendar view, displaying the days of the current month in a grid format.
    Sprint 3: Integrate the provided JSON data to populate the calendar with event markers.
    Sprint 4: Implement a detail view for events, accessible by clicking on event markers in the calendar.
    Sprint 5: Create a form allowing users to add new events dynamically.
    Sprint 6: Ensure responsive design, adapting layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
    Sprint 7: Add optional features like filters, animations, and local storage for session persistence.

Each sprint includes a checklist for tracking progress, with documentation of challenges and solutions to support learning and interview preparation.

Sprint 1: Project Setup and Skeleton Structure

Objective: Establish the initial file structure and basic HTML layout for the project, providing a skeleton for the calendar, event details, and navigation bar. This will set the foundation for future sprints by organizing the code and files effectively.
Tasks:

    Create Project Structure:
        Set up folders and files as per the planned structure:
            index.html, styles/styles.css, scripts/main.js, scripts/calendar.js, scripts/events.js, scripts/form.js, data/sportData.json, README.md, and approach.md.

    Initialize HTML Structure in index.html:
        Add placeholders for:
            Calendar Section: Div to hold the monthly calendar grid.
            Event Detail Section: Placeholder for the event details page.
            Navigation Bar: Simple nav bar with links (initially inactive) for Calendar and Add Event pages.

    Basic CSS Setup:
        In styles.css, add simple styling to differentiate sections visually.
        Set up basic grid layout for the calendar section (placeholder).

    Push to GitHub:
        Commit the initial project setup and structure.
        Ensure the repository is private for now.

    Document Progress:
        Update README.md with a brief note on the initial setup.
        Document the completion of each task in this sprint backlog in approach.md.
