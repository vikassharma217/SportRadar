Task 1 – Calendar View
    •Objective: Implement a calendar view that displays sports events.
•Instructions:
•
    o   Create a calendar interface for the current month.
    o   Display the days of the month in a grid format.
    o   Indicate days that have scheduled sports events. This can be as simple as a dot or marker
            on the day.
    o   (Optional) Show brief information about the events on the calendar (e.g., event name on
            the day cell). 
            
    Sample Events to Include (you can leverage the json file shared to get events):
        o   Sat., 18.07.2019, 18:30, Football, Salzburg vs. Sturm
        o   Sun., 23.10.2019, 09:45, Ice Hockey, KAC vs. Capitals
        
Task 2 – Event Detail Page
    •Objective: Provide a way to view full details of a specific event.
•Instructions:
    o   Implement functionality so that when a user clicks on an event marker on the calendar,
            they are taken to a detail page.
    o   The detail page should display all relevant information about the event, such as date,
            time, sport, teams/participants, and any other details you consider important.

Task 3 – Add Event Functionality
    •Objective: Allow users to add new events during runtime.
    •Instructions:
    o   Create a form where users can input details for a new event (e.g., date, time, sport,
            teams/participants).
    o   Implement the functionality to add the new event to the calendar view.
    o   Note: It is not required to save the data persistently (e.g., no need to use a database or
        local storage). The new event can exist only during the current session (runtime).

Task 4 – Responsiveness
    •Objective: Ensure the site is fully responsive on mobile and tablet devices.
    •Instructions:
    o   Use responsive design techniques to make sure the calendar view and all pages adapt to
            different screen sizes.
    o   Test your site on various screen widths to ensure usability on mobile phones, tablets,
            and desktops.
    o   Pay attention to layout, readability, and touch interactions on smaller screens.

Task 5 – Navigation
    •Objective: Create a simple navigation system within your application.
    •Instructions:
    o   Implement a navigation bar or menu that allows users to switch between the calendar
            overview and the "Add Event" page.
    o   Ensure the navigation is accessible from all pages.
    o   The design can be minimal; focus on functionality.
